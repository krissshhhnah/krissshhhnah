You may call me _Krishna_, an **AI Engineer** who likes building AI systems that are actually **_intelligent_**

I **live, love, breathe and build AI** and in my leisure time, I do graphic designing, drawing, video editing and gaming. So in either ways, my creativity flows.
> Fun Fact: I designed the banner you are seeing here! And yeah, I love to "pspspsps" at cats!

I enjoy turning *“this prompt works”* into *“this system works.”*
I prioritize **system design, reliability, and clarity** over demos or hype.

### What I *Say* I Do

- Code Python
- Build AI stuff
- Debug things that were “working yesterday”
- Find prompts for Nanobanana from Instagram (which I actually do)

## What I *Actually* Build

### Dynamic RAG Systems  
Not “chat with PDF” demos.

- Session-isolated document ingestion
- Vector stores scoped per user/session
- Controlled retrieval to reduce hallucinations
- Designed with failure modes in mind

In short: **RAG systems that don’t confidently make things up.**


### Agentic Engineering Review Orchestrator  
This is where things stop being funny.

- Multi-agent system for **security**, **architecture**, and **code-quality** analysis  
- Config-driven risk scoring (org policies, thresholds, ownership)
- Aggregated recommendations with prioritization
- Generates **executive-ready Markdown reports**

It’s not a chatbot.  
It’s an **internal engineering decision-support system**.

## Things I stumbled upon, on the way

- Won a **National-level Hackathon** with a intelligent system that solved problems of a domain, I was new to.  
- Was the **Founding Coordinator** of a **National Level Tech Fest** at my College.  
- Implemented **agent-based orchestration** for automated analysis and decision-making

### How I Think About AI

- Prompt cleverness fades. System design doesn’t.  
- If it can’t be configured, it can’t scale.  
- If it can’t fail safely, it *will* fail loudly.  
- “It works” is meaningless without “it keeps working”.
